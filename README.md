# Didn't complete as tried to obey the time constraint 
# Got the bulk of the content done & tested, yet to implement:
### proper type safety (didn't have the time, opted out to get a MVP)
### filter search (using .filter)
### fully functional sorter (works but is temperamental) & accompanying tests

# Each component is independant but remains in the same file for ease of use
